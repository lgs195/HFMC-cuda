A High-Fidelity Monte-Carlo ray tracing program coded in Python-cuda.

In this study, we developed a CUDA-implemented program, namely PGS–MC, tailored for precise quantification of the radiation and polarization characteristics in multicomponent polydisperse debris cloud systems. The accuracy of the VRT process in our program was validated through typical Rayleigh and Mie scattering cases. The necessity of accounting for the optical properties of different types of particles is emphasized by comparing the scattering phase matrix and 𝐷𝑜𝐿𝑃 obtained using the PGS–MC and the integration method. Subsequently, the convergence of the results was demonstrated by studying the bidirectional polarization distribution for different photon numbers and radius groups, and appropriate simulation parameters were selected. Finally, the effects of various factors on the radiation and polarization were investigated. Further, simulations of the imaging were performed.
